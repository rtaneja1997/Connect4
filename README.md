# Connect4

Our team set out to incorporate various AI players into a pre-existing implementation of a Connect 4 game.

The core components of our project consist of three modules:

1. Connect4 Module: Got source code from https://github.com/KeithGalli/Connect4-Python, which ran a Connect4 game between two humans.
We made changes to this code to allow for AI's to be involved in gameplay, as well as have various modes of gameplay occur.

2. AI Module: We implemented three AI players that could play the Connect4 game. The first of which is an unintelligent player that chooses its moves randomly. The second is a smart player utilizing the minimax algorithm to make decisions. Finally, the best player utilizes minimax with alpha-beta pruning to find good moves in shorter time periods as well as function at higher 'intelligence' levels 

3. Main Module: Interface for the game. Allows a user to choose which game mode to play as well as how 'hard' AI's should be.
