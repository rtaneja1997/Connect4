# Connect4
ai stuff 




Done:
- Implemented random player
- Implemented minimax player 

To do: 
- Test minimax player (currently tested at depth of 4, no pr


Notes:
- minimax was acting kinda weird with numpy so i rewrote a small portion of connect4.py without using numpy. minimax seems fine now but we should still check for bugs by playtesting.
